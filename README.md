<h1>How To Play</h1>
The goal of the game is for everyone to get rid of all of their cards in order. So if the player 1 had a 1 and  player 2 had a 100 then player 1 would play first and player 2 second. The thing is that you cannot communicate with each other.
You have to figure out the if you go next or if someone else goes next based off of your own cards, prevoiuslly played cards, and how everyone plays. You can see how many cards each player has left and what cards they played, but that's all you get to know about the other players.

<h1>Game Selection</h1>
The can select between a full run game, custom game, or play a certain level from the main menu(lobby). You first need a host to make a server name and make his own username, then the host can give send an email to the other players.
In the lobby you can also set and change your username, and talk to the other players. The chat saves from game to game and only deletes if everyone leaves.

<h1>Most Importantly</h1>
Have fun and try to win!
